ðŸ‘‹ Hi there!

I'm a Master's student in Artificial Intelligence at Korea University supervised by Prof. [Sungjoon Choi](https://sites.google.com/view/sungjoon-choi/home). I also spent four months as a Visiting Researcher at Queen's University, Canada, working under Prof. [Matthew Pan](https://mithrilab.com/).

My research interests lie at the intersection of `physical human-robot interaction` and `Embodied AI`. I'm especially passionate about creating robots that people enjoy being around â€” not just robots that are functionally capable, but ones that bring `joy and engagement to human interaction`.

I've worked with various robotic platforms including [UR5e](https://www.universal-robots.com/products/ur5-robot/), [Stretch 3](https://hello-robot.com/product), and [Ambidex](https://www.naverlabs.com/en/ambidex), and I truly enjoy building robotic systems and designing engaging demos. My goal is to create robots that feel like companions, not just tools.

Letâ€™s make robots more human-friendlyâ€”and more fun!
